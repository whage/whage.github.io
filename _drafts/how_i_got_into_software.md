In 2013, just at the beginning of my journey into software I started writing blog posts.
It's been only a few months since I wrote my first lines of javascript and php code.
At the end of 2012 I quit working for a big insurance company (a job wich I hated)
after saving up enough money to keep me going for a few months until I find something that can at least pay the bills.

... I felt like I don't belong anywhere professionally and that bothered me ...

I came across a forum thread where people were talking about their experiences buying and selling web portals and having nice passive incomes running web-based businesses.
That got me interested. I started learning about the web. For a few months I spent most of my waketime reading articles and tutorials about web development. It was a very intense period.
The idea was to first learn about website design & development and then get into some online business, maybe buy a webshop or portal
and try to make a profit running it. 

As I learned more and more about the programming part, I got less and less interested about the business part.
I enjoyed programming a lot, it felt like I finally found something I'd like to call my profession.
So my focus shifted from "having a web-based business" to "becoming a programmer".

I thought if I wrote some technical blog posts, it would help me get noticed and get a few freelance jobs,
maybe even a permanent one.

- how my focus shifted to other areas of software
- why I decided to go back to school
    - how has it helped ?
