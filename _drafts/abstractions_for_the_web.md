Why does it seem like every area of software development, like graphics programming, machine learning, distributed systems, OS level stuff is full of math-heavy algorithms and clever abstractions but I see almost nothing like that in my daily work as a web backend developer.
Maybe I'm not using the right environment, maybe not the right tools or maybe I'm just terrible at what I do.
One central thing that we web developers work with a lot is the Database. Very often a relational database.
