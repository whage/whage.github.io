- what rly happens when you say "pass by ref or value" in higher level languages
- what do you mutate
- how do you copy values (ref / value)
- what is the significance of pointers in C
    - scope
    - values returned from functions
    - efficiency
    - direct mapping to ASM / hardware
        - higher lvl languages shield you from manipulating memory addresses directly
    - problems that pointers create
