# stack-heap
- struggled with this topic for years without a proper explanation
- CS:APP helped a lot

# names
- unfortunate naming: both refer to a data structure as well as a type of memory allocation
- the heap as in virtual memory has nothing to do with the heap data structure
- the stack as in static mamory allocation (?) follows the stack principle (?)
- "call stack" and "stack memory" - different things?

# key differences
- the stack uses hardware support from the processor (push, pop, etc...), the heap doesn't
- the 

# garbage collection
- relation to the stack or heap?
