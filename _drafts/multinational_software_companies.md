I believe all these stem from:
- being a multinational company
- greenfield project (I always thought this was good)

- being bombarded with meetings kills your focus
- pointless meetings on managemenet bullshit
- huge language barrier with foreign colleagues in online meetings, hardly any real information is exchanged
- most time is spent debating stuff and everyone just wants to show off their knowledge
- template based everything
- incredible bureaucracy and endless processes everywhere - everything has to go through several people
- politics!
- nothing ever gets finished, directions and goals change constantly
- overcomplication in technology - unjustified complexity in architecture and 3rd party software usage
- useless product
