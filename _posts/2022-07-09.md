- lots of stress in the past months
- lots of stuff to pay, everything is getting so expensive
- moving with a small kid is very hard
- finishing renovation with a small kid is very hard
- mind completely clouded with things that need to be done and paid
- had a moment of clarity on a saturday afternoon when I was reading about the ubuntu package `icedtea-netx` (need to install Java Web Start for applying for some government subsidy) - "implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP)"
	- somehow it brought back that lost feeling of excitement and curiosity about software and computers that I used to feel when I started out
	- maybe because the acronym is similar to JPL which I'll always associate with one of the [most motivating articles about software][nasa] I ever read
	- I really lost this feeling in the past 1-2 years since my son was born
	- I want to get it back, I want to feel excited and curious about software again
	- want to work on meaningful things and not waste my working life just for the money
