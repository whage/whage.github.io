At least every other day I fall asleep next to my son after putting him to bed in the evening. Quite early, around 9-10PM.
He is my #1 priority so I spend most of my free time (after work) with him - and I encourage every other dad with a small kid
to do the same.
I realized that lately I barely spend any time honing my software skills or learning about new areas, things which I think would be important if I want
to spend my working time on worthy things, have fulfilling jobs and a safe financial background.
I also noticed how easy it is to waste that 1-2 hours that I have when I don't fall asleep too early - watching videos, reading random articles.
To try and help me stay focused, here is list of things I started learning about:

- [a secure home network][routerguide]
- OpenBSD
- virtualization, QEMU, KVM (virt-manager)

I'm planning to pick up c/c++. Again. Been planning that for a long time.
I had the idea to spend some time learning about interesting open source c/c++ open source project and doing
a summary writeup of their architectures. See [older post][cpp-projects] with some inspiration on what to pick
