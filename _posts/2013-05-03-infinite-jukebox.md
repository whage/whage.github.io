In online poker - or poker in general - the term 'grinder' or 'grinding'
refers to the very monotonous and long lasting activity of playing many hands over the course of long hours.
I hate poker jargon with a passion but find this one rather fitting. It's quite appropriate for writing code as well.<br>

When I do something that requires a lot of concentration I either need complete scilence or a very monotonous 'noise' or some similar music to.
I recently found [echo nest][echo-nest], a group of fantastic software devs who are concerned with analyzing music.
One of their creations was [this][jukebox], The Infinite Jukebox.
This is how it works: analyze music -> find similar or identical sections -> randomly but seamlessly jump through these sections while playing -> never stop playing it without us noticing the jumps.

Nothing would be better to produce good 'grinder music': it filters out background noises, it's fairly monotonous, thus not distracting (imo), it helps me stay focused.


Here I'll post some of the tracks I find very good to listen to while coding, studying or doing stuff that requires concentration.
