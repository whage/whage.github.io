I'm not allowed to delete while writing this post.
I just deleted. No more. So I want to get rid of the feeling
of anxiety when I start writing a post. Noone will read it anyway, unless
I show it to someone, so this is just for me.
I want to track what I'm learning about beacuse even my limited learning
is spent on random posts that I find in an ad-hoc manner. The topics
may be close to my interests and even career opportinities but what I'm doing
is so disorganized that I'm afraid it is only an illusion that any actual
learning is taking place.
So let me summarize in this post what I've been reading about in the past
few days and maybe I can continue doing this.

- wifi security: been reading the [intro docs to nzyme][nzyme]
- low level, hardware: [data centers and cpu designs][dick-sites-dc]
- low level, OS: memory alignment - what it really means and why it is important
	- some gaps in my understanding - can't really find any in-depth explanation :(
- networking: [how DNS works][linux-dns]
- networking: [tcpdump and wireshark][julia-wireshark]
- linux, containers: [docker vs podman, buildah, skopeo][goodbye-docker]

By doing this, I might be able to spot some patterns of "useless browsing" and
"focused learning" and strive to do more and more of the latter.
Writing this took about 5-10 minutes. 5 is ok, but shouldn' be much more.
