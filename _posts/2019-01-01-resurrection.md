A [good friend][imi] of mine and I agreed to start blogging again.
We both believe it would bring several benefits:
- improve our english / writing skills
- help us consolidate our thoughts on various topics we are currently learning
- motivate us to concentrate on topics we are interested in
- grow our online presence

I decided to resurrect my old blog that I started - and then abandoned - in 2013.
I looked up all of my old posts, some of them I had to recover from [The Wayback Machine][wayback-machine]
because I deleted them once I thought they wouldn't fit into the image I was trying to build of myself.

Here is a short story of how I got into software development.

In 2013, just at the beginning of my journey into software I started writing blog posts.
It's been only a few months since I wrote my first lines of javascript and php code.
At the end of 2012 I quit working for a big insurance company (a job wich I hated)
after saving up enough money to keep me going for a few months until I find something that can at least pay the bills.

... I felt like I don't belong anywhere professionally and that bothered me ...

I came across a forum thread where people were talking about their experiences buying and selling web portals and having nice passive incomes running web-based businesses.
That got me interested. I started learning about the web. For a few months I spent most of my waketime reading articles and tutorials about web development. It was a very intense period.
The idea was to first learn about website design & development and then get into some online business, maybe buy a webshop or portal
and try to make a profit running it. 

As I learned more and more about the programming part, I got less and less interested about the business part.
I enjoyed programming a lot, it felt like I finally found something I'd like to call my profession.
So my focus shifted from "having a web-based business" to "becoming a programmer".

I thought if I wrote some technical blog posts, it would help me get noticed and get a few freelance jobs,
maybe even a permanent one.

So I decided to restore my old blog posts instead of hiding them.
The recovery process was very nostalgic. My [first post][jukebox-post] I ever wrote even mentions my past in online poker.

There is [this post][magento-post] where I describe my experience with Magento that I tried to learn in about a week to create a webshop for a local company. It was a terrible failure as I couldn't deliever a single webpage in 3 weeks and the contractor got so upset with me he didn't pick up the phone for the next month.

Or [this gem][microscript-post] where I create a cron job php script to send me email notifications when a new versions of a library comes out instead of pinning its version down. What a great idea.
