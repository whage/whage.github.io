A [good friend][imi] of mine and I agreed to start blogging again.
We both believe it would bring several benefits:
- improve our english / writing skills
- help us consolidate our thoughts on various topics we are currently learning about
- motivate us to concentrate on topics we are interested in
- grow our online presence

I decided to resurrect my old blog that I started - and then abandoned - in 2013.
I looked up all of my old posts, some of them I had to recover from [The Wayback Machine][wayback-machine]
because I deleted them once I thought they wouldn't fit into the image I was trying to build of myself.

I decided to restore the old posts instead of hiding them.
The recovery process was very nostalgic. My [first post][jukebox-post] I ever wrote even mentions my past in online poker.

There is [this post][magento-post] where I describe my experience with Magento that I tried to learn in about a week to create a webshop for a local company. It was a terrible failure as I couldn't deliever a single webpage in 3 weeks and the contractor got so upset with me he didn't pick up the phone for the next month.

Or [this gem][microscript-post] where I create a php script for cron to send me email notifications when a new versions of a font comes out instead of pinning its version down. What a great idea.
