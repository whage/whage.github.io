Autumn is such a beatiful season. Just saying.
This quick post is a reminder of the stuff I need to do:

- set up a proper home network -> keep learning about OpenWRT and [buy a router][openwrt]
- keep learning about C++, updated my private larning notes, should make them public here. Main items:
	- read the saved docs, starting with [this][ms-modern-cpp]
	- [Orthanc][orthanc]
	- [OpenTTD][openttd]

[orthanc]: https://hg.orthanc-server.com/
