Yesterday I made up my mind, I'll learn C++. Properly this time. Seriously.

I've long pondered what areas of software I want to get into the most. It is still blurry but
I know it is not CRUD applications and definitely not (dev)Ops. I've had enough of yaml files
and bash and python scripts and clicking buttons on web UIs.

I concluded [this post 1,5 years ago][which-way] with a note that I should put my focus on lower level languages.
I put some effort into learning to program in Go in the past half year. It went quite good too,
I'm not disappointed with my progress. I am disappointed at the job market though.
As of May 2020, there are very few open Go positions in Budapest. There might be a lot more abroad
but I won't be moving anytime soon - expecting a son in August this year.

C++ on the other hand is in very high demand.

There are many C++ jobs on the market and it's crazy how many interesting branches of software make use of C and C++:

- embedded systems
- automotive software
- game programming
- operating systems and systems programming
- compilers
- scientific computing, simulations
- fintech
- graphics, rendering
- image and signal processing
- all kinds of desktop applications

I'm fairly confident about my PL knowledge and programming skills now. I've tried a good amount of langauges,
seen things from different angles and built a decent understanding of the fundamentals.
Now I need to learn how those things came together in Bjarne Stroustrup's head.
At first sight, C++ seems like a monster. Lots of different language constructs, syntactic elements
and a good pile of legacy tooling.

The most important bits that I need to learn are:
- where are the best documentation?
- what constitutes the cpp ecosystem (dev tools, runtimes, libraries)?
- how are 3rd party libs used in projects?
- what compilers are the most popular and why?
- how does the compiler and the linker work?
- what is a "modern" style of cpp? (and what other styles are there?)
- how do people structure their cpp projects?

So, in half a year (maybe less?), I want to be able to get at least medior level C++ jobs. We'll see.
I'll be reading books, doing small projects, reading source code on Github.

Some reminders for future me:
- read books in multiple passes, don't get slowed by all the details!
- build something simple and build it step by step!
- look into open source C++ projects, try to contribute!
