A [good friend][imi] of mine and I agreed to set up a blog during the Christmas holidays.

I decided to resurrect my old blog that I started - and then abandoned - in 2013.
I had to look up my old posts, some of them I had to recover from [The Wayback Machine][wayback-machine]
because I haven't kept a copy of them.

The recovery process was very nostalgic.
[My first post][jukebox-post] even mentions my past in online poker.
There is [this post][magento-post] where I describe my experience with Magento that I tried to learn in about a week to create a webshop for a local company. It was a terrible failure as I couldn't deliever a single webpage in 3 weeks and the contractor got so upset with me he didn't pick up the phone for a month. I had no idea about webshops or backend development.
Or [this gem][microscript-post] where I create a php script for cron to send me email notifications when a new versions of a font comes out instead of pinning its version in the URL. What a great idea.

Anyways, a few years have passed and my professional interests changed a lot. Well, everything changed a lot.
I'll be publishing some articles that I've been secretly drafting.

Here are the goals I hope to accomplish with this blog:
- learn how to write quickly and concisely - posts that are actually enjoyable to read
- keep a record of professional / personal events
- motivate me to get a deeper understanding of things - deep enough so I can write about them
- help me focus more on some technologies I find interesting
