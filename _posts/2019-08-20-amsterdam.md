We are taking a short nap in the hotel room close to the Vondelpark and the Van Gogh Museum.
I'm thinking about looking through the local job market online. First I googled for 
"maritime tech jobs in Amsterdam" but quickly realized I'm not yet qualified for any of that.
Now I'm looking at search results on Glassdoor for "aws cloud devops linux" terms.
Most of them start with a "Senior" prefix which seems quite scary.
Key qualifications they expect:

- 5+ years of general, 2+ years of relevant experience
- strong Unix/Linux OS and networking knowledge
- AWS, Azure, GCP
- containerization: Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos
- config management, CI/CD, automation: Chef/Ansible/Puppet, Terraform, Packer, Jenkins
- monitoring: Grafana, Prometheus, Zabbix
- distributed systems tech: Couchbase, Redis, Cassandra, ElasticSearch
- big adat: Hadoop, Kafka, Spark


Ok. Half of that I don't even want to know.
