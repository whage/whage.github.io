It feels like it's been years since I last wrote anything here. A lot must have happened to me last year.
Many things happened indeed. I got married, I had a great honeymoon in Tuscany, I've done a lot of work as the sole full time developer at Bioscreen and since september I'm back in school finally officially studying CS and software engineering.
I sincerely hope that will help me beat my ever-present impostor syndrome for good.

It is really hard working full time, going to school and having a life at the same time ...
Anyways, I'm posting this because I want to set some goals and make them public. Here we go:

- pass (and possibly with a good grade) tomorrow's algorithms exam
- finish my first 2 semesters successfully
- spend quality time with my family and friends! call them regularly!
- work out much more ragularly, like in the old days
- seriously. find balance between mental and physical activity
- save a 3rd of my salary every month
- ride my bike more! it was so much fun with Levi last week back on the mountains
- finish the MOOCs I started - MIT 6.00.2x and Andrew Ng's machine learning course and try to apply that knowledge at work
- have fun, for God's sake!

Let's go hard in 2017.
