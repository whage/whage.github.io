Can I write a blog post while my wife is taking a shower? Let's see.
Currently I'm learning go as I planned to do this year, but it wasn't until our last retro 2 weeks ago with my team
where we decided we have to get ourselves up to speed with 3 topics: Go, Kubernetes and general Linux stuff.
Shower stopped.
