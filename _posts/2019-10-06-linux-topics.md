Last friday I gave a [presentation][fs-prez] about file systems to some of my collegues.
I spent quite some time preparing for it. There were still some holes that
could have been filled but overall it turned out well, they seemed to have enjoyed it.
But what's more important is that I finally understood the basic concepts related
to file systems which haunted me for a long long time. It all really makes sense now
and it feels good!

I also went through the install guide of Arch Linux and installed it on a VM after hearing
that some of my teammates were well ahead of me in this regard.
The GUI part is still ahead and I expect to learn a fair bit while I'm getting through it.

It looks like I'm making some good progress in the world of Linux!
As a short term goal, I want to get to a point where I can do everything work-related
using CLI and terminal based programs.

Here is a short list of tools I need to learn more about to achieve that:
- tmux (use it to its fullest)
- vim (to a point where I feel I'm most productive in vim)
- ?

And some other topics I'll be learning about in the near future:
- Kubernetes and related cloud services (will be using it at work)
- GO (nothing is pushing me on this front unfortunately)
- virtualization (will be preparing a presentation on this topic!)
