We moved in to our new apartment near Buda√∂rs.

Life plans:
- start learning about woodworking, start using dad's tools
    - make something simple! some basic furniture
- get a glider plance licence by next summer/fall (2020)
- grow some plants from the seeds we have gathered with Szilvi
- get a car and travel, visit family more often!

I'll write a separate post about professional goals for the next year.
