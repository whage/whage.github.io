What a horrible title, but I couldn't come up with a better one.
Today I again found some [nice video][rct-reveng] about reverse engineering. Then I remembered that one HN thread where
people mentioned [overthewire/vortex][votex] and how they would consider "elite" someone who reached lvl25
and then went on to find more interesting stuff about infosec topics and then I bump into some [hungarian guy's name][zsombor]
who is presenting at some major security conference and then came again that thought that haunts me every once in a while:
what I know about programming and computers is laughable compared to these people and even though my dayjob is writing
software it feels ridiculous compared to these topics.

Every now and then I get this urge to learn more about infosec and vulnerabilities so that maybe some day
I could make a living doing this. Seems so distant.

I really want to make an organized post out of this but I just can't seem to be focused enough.
Some notes for later:
- assembly
- debuggers
- ghidra
