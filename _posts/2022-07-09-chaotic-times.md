- lots of stress in the past months
- lots of stuff to pay, everything is getting so expensive
- moving with a small kid is very hard
- home renovation with a small kid is very hard
- mind completely clouded with things that need to be taken care of and things that need to be paid
- had a moment of clarity on a saturday afternoon when I was reading about the ubuntu package `icedtea-netx` - "implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP)" (need to install Java Web Start for applying for some government subsidy)
	- somehow, out of the blue, reading  that one line brought back that lost feeling of excitement and curiosity about software and computers that I used to feel when I started out
	- maybe because the acronym is similar to JPL which I'll always associate with one of the [most motivating articles about software engineering][nasa]
	- I really lost this feeling in the past 1-2 years since my son was born (not blaming him!) and the only time I spend writing software is my dayjob
	- I want to get it back, I want to feel excited and curious about software again
	- want to work on meaningful things and not waste my working life just for the money
