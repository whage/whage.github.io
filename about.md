I'm a software developer from Budapest, Hungary.
Started out as a self-taught web application developer.
My interests gradually shifted towards other domains of the software world,
mostly the lower layers - systems software, operating systems, networking.
I eventually acquired a Bsc in computer science & software engineering.
Been working on cloud infrastructure automation since 2018.
