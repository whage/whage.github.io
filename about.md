I'm a software developer from Budapest, Hungary.
I started my software career as a web application developer but my interests
gradually shifted towards other domains of the computing world,
mostly the lower layers - operating systems, networks, things close to the hardware.
I began as a self-taught developer but eventually acquired a Bsc in
computer science & software engineering.

I spent the first 5 years of my software career with the good old LAMP stack and javascript.
Then in 2018 I switched to cloud infrastructure / devops and I'm still in that field as of 2024.

Besides my day job, I have a side project / business partnership where we develop and provide
a [PACS][pacs] and medical image sharing application stack to health care providers.
At the core of our stack are the [Orthanc DICOM server][orthanc], the [OHIF image viewer][ohif],
a custom, minimal DICOM worklist server ([golang][golang])
and a minimal worklist management UI (proudly written in [Elm][elm]).
