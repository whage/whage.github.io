I'm a software developer from Budapest, Hungary.
Started out as a self-taught web application developer.
My interests gradually shifted towards other domains of the software world,
mostly the lower layers - systems software, operating systems, networking.
I eventually acquired a Bsc in computer science & software engineering.

I spent the first 5 years of my software career as a web application developer with
a very traditional LAMP stack.
After that the following 5 years were cloud infrastructure / devops.
What will the 3rd 5 years be about?

Besides my day job, I have a side project / business partnership where we develop and provide
a [PACS][pacs] and medical image sharing application stack to health care providers.
At the core of our stack are the [Orthanc DICOM server][orthanc], the [OHIF image viewer][ohif],
a custom, minimal DICOM worklist server ([golang][golang])
and a minimal worklist management UI (proudly written in [Elm][elm]).
