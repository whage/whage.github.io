I'm a software developer from Budapest, Hungary.
I started out as a web application developer but my interests gradually shifted towards ~~other domains of the software world,
where the scope of the work is broader and where the focus is on performance and efficiency instead of just speed of development.~~
Who am I kidding...

Currently I work at [evosoft][evosoft], a Siemens subsidiary in a devops role on cloud-based infrastructure.
I'm also earning my Bsc degree in computer science and engineering.
