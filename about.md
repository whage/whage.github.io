Hi! I'm Andr√°s, a software developer from Budapest, Hungary.

I started out as a web application developer but my interests gradually shifted towards other domains of the software world,
where the scope of the work is broader and where the focus is on performance and efficiency instead of just the speed of development.

Currently I work at [evosoft][evosoft], a Siemens subsidiary in a devops role on cloud-based infrastructure. I'm also earning my Bsc degree in computer science and engineering.
